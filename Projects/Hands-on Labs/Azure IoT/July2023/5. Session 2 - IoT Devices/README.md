<h1>Session 2 - IoT Devices</h1>

<h2>What Are IoT Devices?</h2>
IoT devices are hardware devices, such as sensors, gadgets, appliances and other machines that collect and exchange data over the Internet. They are programmed for certain applications and can be embedded into other IoT devices.

The goal of the <b>Session 2</b> is to know how the IoT Device is working, how can be connected and managed, etc. and also how we can create an IoT Device from the scratch for our needs.
